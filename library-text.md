# Met obs instruments

Instruments for measuring sunshine, temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind.
Ranging in age from mid 19th century till the present.
Cabinet 17: early sunshine recorders worked by focusing the rays of sun through spherical lens and burning a trace in a card. Automatic sunshine sensor (down right) measures the amount of radiation falling on a pair of sensors.
Cabinet 18: Various models of thermometers: the first belonging to newly formed Meteorological Department (1854), 1868 model from a telegraph station in Portsmouth,1902 designed for Robert Scott's Antarctic expedition and maximum thermometer which recorded the highest ever shade temperature in UK (38.5C in Brogdale, Kent, 2003).
Cabinet 19: micro-barograph designed to show small variations in atmospheric pressure (right), precision aneroid barometer (left)
Cabinet 20: a range of air meters and anemometers, designed to measure wind speed, as well as dial (top right corner) measuring wind direction.

# HMS Beagle

Model of the ship captained by Robert FitzRoy, future founder of the Met Office. On its second voyage, crew of the Beagle was joined by young Charles Darwin. Many of his scientific theories were inspired by the observations taken while on the journey and his memoirs and remarks would later be published in the book The Voyage of the Beagle.

# Meteorological air observer uniform

The mess kit uniform of Wing Commander Bryn Lewis, who served as Meteorological Air Observer during the Second World War. His task was to gather upper-air weather observations from an aircraft, hence he was stationed at RAF bases. Meteorological sorties were often flown deep into the enemy’s territory and over the Atlantic and 52 aircraft never returned. The observations were used to prepare weather forecasts to advise further military actions.

# Weather lore

The body of informal folklore relating to predicting the weather, includes proverbs and superstitions, ranging from the accurate to the absurd. Many infer the changes in weather from the behaviour of plants and animals, some focus on astronomy, astrology and clouds. The exhibition includes a wide range of records from 1480 “Dialogues on meteorology and astronomy" to the modern publications.

# Library

The library is open to the public and offers a range of reference materials and materials for loan, on-site internet access to key online journals and free WiFi . Apart from the collection of books, journals and reports, the records include archive of original meteorological data, weather charts, private weather diaries and more. Increasing amount of content is being digitised and available on the internet.

# Aeroplanes

* 8 models of aircraft used for observations, from 1944 up until present day;
* Includes "Snoopy", Met Office Research Flight Aircraft, used by Met Office from 1973 until 2001 to measure atmospheric variables, radiation, cloud variables, atmospheric chemistry (see Library Factsheet "Take Flight");
* Oldest aircrafts in display are Meteorological Research Flight (MRF) used from '46-'52 and the Mosquito, used from '44-'55. MRF measured up to 20000ft while Mosquito could fly up to 40000ft so was used for measuring stratosphere.
* Newest aircraft in display is Met Office Civil Contingencies Aircraft (Mossa) Cessna 421, used to measure volcanic ash in atmosphere. Can also measure aerosols, such as those from large fires. Used by Met Office Hazard Centre.

# Portrait, Clock

* Admiral Fitzroy was the first director of the MO, appointed in 1854;
* He was a pioneer of meteorology and forecasting;
* Clock was presented to Fitzroy by Minister of Marine and Colonies of France in 1864 in recognition of the storm warning system which he provided to the French Navy;
* Clock was bequeathed to MO in 1943 by a daughter of Fitzroy.

# D-Day Chart

* Copy of the weather chart from 13:00 on 6th June, 1944;
* Complied using data from Met Office (then part of Air Ministry), Royal Navy's Weather Service and the US Army Air Force;
* D-day landings had been postponed from the 5th due to stormy weather over the English Channel. They were then given the go ahead for the 6th due to a high pressure system over the Atlantic which was predicted to bring good weather;
* Weather observations from German-occupied Europe are visible on the Allied chart as they had been deciphered from German radio transmissions.

# Skua Rocket

* Skua solid-fuel rocket system created by Bristol Aerojet Ltd
* Rocket was recovered from Salisbury Plain by Gordon Bridge after a test flight;
* Gordon Bridge was a Project Officer for MO Skua sounding rocket programme;
* MO High Altitude Research Branch used Skua rockets to study atmosphere up to 80km;
* Programme commenced in 1959 and ran until late '70s;
* Used in Scotland, Wales, Sweden, French Guiana and Maldives.

# AMSU-B Engineering Model

* Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B): microwave radiometer sensitive to atmospheric temperature and humidity;
* Used on US satellites NOAA-16 (1998 launch), NOAA-17 (2000) and NOAA-18 (2002);
* Engineering model on display is a prototype used as a flight spare on NOAA-17;
* All flight instruments on AMSU-B were procured and tested by the MO and supplied to NOAA;
* Data from AMSU-B is used by MO in operational forecasting models.
