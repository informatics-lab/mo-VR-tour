# Met obs instruments

Instruments for measuring sunshine, temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind.
Ranging in age from mid 19th century till the present.
Cabinet 17: early sunshine recorders worked by focusing the rays of sun through spherical lens and burning a trace in a card. Automatic sunshine sensor (down right) measures the amount of radiation falling on a pair of sensors.
Cabinet 18: Various models of thermometers: the first belonging to newly formed Meteorological Department (1854), 1868 model from a telegraph station in Portsmouth,1902 designed for Robert Scott's Antarctic expedition and maximum thermometer which recorded the highest ever shade temperature in UK (38.5C in Brogdale, Kent, 2003).
Cabinet 19: micro-barograph designed to show small variations in atmospheric pressure (right), precision aneroid barometer (left)
Cabinet 20: a range of air meters and anemometers, designed to measure wind speed, as well as dial (top right corner) measuring wind direction.

# HMS Beagle

Model of the ship captained by Robert FitzRoy, future founder of the Met Office. On its second voyage, crew of the Beagle was joined by young Charles Darwin. Many of his scientific theories were inspired by the observations taken while on the journey and his memoirs and remarks would later be published in the book The Voyage of the Beagle.

# Meteorological air observer uniform

The mess kit uniform of Wing Commander Bryn Lewis, who served as Meteorological Air Observer during the Second World War. His task was to gather upper-air weather observations from an aircraft, hence he was stationed at RAF bases. Meteorological sorties were often flown deep into the enemy’s territory and over the Atlantic and 52 aircraft never returned. The observations were used to prepare weather forecast to advise further military actions.

# Weather lore

The body of informal folklore relating to predicting the weather, includes proverbs and superstitions, ranging from the accurate to the absurd. Many infer the changes in weather from the behaviour of plants and animals, some focus on astronomy, astrology and clouds. The exhibition includes a wide range of records from 1480 “Dialogues on meteorology and astronomy) to the modern publications.
